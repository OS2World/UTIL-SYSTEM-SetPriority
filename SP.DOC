SetPriority Version 1.04 by Jens Glathe 12-01-1995

This is a utility to start a program at a defined priority.  It is also able to
start a VDM (DOS-session) at a defined priority.

What's new:

An interface to the DOS settings of the WPS has been added. It provides the 
two (or three, depends on the version of OS/2 you use) additional DOS set-
tings:

SESSION_PRIORITY_API (default: on) Enables the VDD interface for this DOS box.
        The API can be accessed through DOS interrupt 45h. This setting is for
        programs that use the VDOSPRIO API (only three ones, AFAIK :).

SESSION_PRIORITY_CLASS (default: 2) Sets the priority class for the program.
        See below.

SESSION_PRIORITY (default: 1) Sets the offset in the priority class for the 
        program. See below.

With this interface, you don't need to use sp.exe or spdos.exe to run a DOS 
program at a defined priority. The only thing you need to do is to create an
Object for the program and change the settings. Of course, you need to load 
the driver VDOSPRIO.SYS at system boot :).

The file sp104.zip contains:

sp.exe OS/2 executable

spdos.exe DOS executable to start a DOS session with other priority

vdosprio.sys Virtual Device Driver for the DOS sessions (MUST be loaded to
change the priority)

setprio.pas, setprio.tpu,

prioint.asm, prioint.obj source for the library used by spdos.exe

setprio.c C header for communication with VDOSPRIO.SYS

sp.doc this file.

\emxdll\*.dll EMX- DLLs needed.  If these are not in your system or newer ones,
copy them to a directory reachable by LIBPATH.  WARNING:  Do not use more than
one version of EMX-DLLs!  This package was compiled using EMX-GCC 0.9a.

Usage of sp:

SP <class>[delta] <sessiontype> <program> [args...]

<class>:  n=no change, i=idle, r=regular, f=foreground, t=time critical
[delta]:  Any number from -31 to 31, 0 to 31 for DOS sessions 
<sessiontype>: o=OS/2 Window or PM App, d=DOS-Window 
<program>:  Executable or Batchfile (OS/2 only) with full path

The driver "VDOSPRIO.SYS" must have been loaded to change the priority of a DOS
session.

If a DOS session shall be started, sp invokes spdos.exe, which sets the
priority of the VDM and executes the program.

You can use spdos directly:

SPDOS <class>[delta] <program_with_path_and_extension> [args...]

If you want to run batch files, use:

SPDOS <class>[delta] <path>\command.com /c <batchfile> [options]

Requirements:

OS/2 version 2.x. or higher. sp.exe and spdos.exe must be reachable by PATH or
in the same directory.  DEVICE=(path)vdosprio.sys in your config.sys file.

Notes:

The VDD hooks the DOS Int 45h to get a connection to the VDM.  I hope that
nobody uses this Interrupt.  If there are problems with this Interrupt,
recompile the VDD and the pascal library for another Interrupt. To obtain the 
source code, just contact me by e-mail (Or better: surface mail or phone).

If you set a DOS session which has an idle loop consuming full cpu time (such
as the Turbo IDE) to time critical (highest) priority, the system gets in
trouble.  Setting the priority to r31 is enough, f is also allowed.

There is another priority class for VDM's:  SIMULATED INTERRUPT, but it is 
for VDD internal use only. Therefore the sp utility doesn't support it.

FOR PROGRAMMERS WHO WANT TO USE THE VDOSPRIO DRIVER DIRECTLY:

The driver can be called by Int 45h.  The parameters are:

AX:  Class

Possible values are:

1H:  Idle Class.  2H:  Regular Class.  3H:  Time-Critical Class.  Highest
Priority class. 4H:  Foreground Server Class.  5H:  Simulated Interrupt Class.
1680H:  Perform a task switch to another task (Try to give up the CPU).

DX:  Offset

Possible values are:

0..1Fh:  absolute Offset for this Class

Return values:

AX=1:  Success.  AX=0:  An error occured.  No actions taken.

There is a better description and a pascal/c interface included with this
package (Files setprio.pas and setprio.h, but partially in german :-) ).

Debug-O-History:

No new bugs fixed in version 1.04.

The Version 1.03 has a VDD for the DOS sessions with more functionality.
Some error messages have been added to spdos.exe.
No new bugs found.

The Version 1.02 contains a completely rewritten VDD for the DOS sessions
(VDOSPRIO.SYS version 2.0).

The Version 1.01 has a minor bug fix in spdos.exe.  There was a problem passing
argv[1] to the DOS program started.

The initial code used as a base for sp.exe is from Scott Dudley, thanks to him.
