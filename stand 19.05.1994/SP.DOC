SetPriority Version 1.02 by Jens Glathe 05-18-1994

This is a utility to start a program at a defined priority.  It 
is also able to start a VDM (DOS-session) at a defined priority.  

What's new:

There was a bug in the VDD "VDOSPRIO.SYS" It has been rewritten 
completely. A bug fix for the IdleCall (AX=1680h, Int 2F) in OS/2
version 2.1 has been added. A help text for spdos.exe has been 
added.

The file sp102.zip contains:  

sp.exe  OS/2 executable

spdos.exe DOS executable to start a DOS session with other
priority

vdosprio.sys  Virtual Device Driver for the DOS sessions (MUST be
loaded to change the priority) 

sp.c, sp.def  source code for sp.exe

sp.rc, sp.ico recource file and icon

spdos.pas source for spdos.exe

setprio.pas, setprio.tpu,

prioint.asm, prioint.obj  source for the library used by 
spdos.exe

setprdd.asm, setprdd.inc, setprdd.def source code for the VDD 
vdosprio.sys

asmsetpr.bat TASM cmdline to assemble the VDD source 

linkprdd.cmd link386 cmdline to link the VDD

sp.doc this file.  

\emxdll\*.dll EMX- DLLs needed. If these are not in your system
or newer ones, copy them to a directory reachable by LIBPATH.
WARNING: Do not use more than one version of EMX-DLLs!
This package was compiled using EMX-GCC 0.8h.

Usage of sp:  

SP <class>[delta] <sessiontype> <program> [args...] 

<class>:  n=no change, i=idle, r=regular, f=foreground, t=time 
critical [delta]:  Any number from -31 to 31, 0 to 31 for DOS 
sessions
<sessiontype>:  o=OS/2 Window or PM App, d=DOS-Window, 
D=DOS-Fullscreen 
<program>:  Executable or Batchfile (OS/2 only) with full path

The driver "VDOSPRIO.SYS" must have been loaded to change the 
priority of a DOS session.  

If a DOS session shall be started, sp invokes spdos.exe, which 
sets the priority of the VDM and executes the program.  

You can use spdos directly:  

SPDOS <class>[delta] <program> [args...] 

If you want to run batch files, use:

SPDOS <class>[delta] <path>\command.com /c <batchfile> [options]

Requirements:  

OS/2 version 2.x. sp.exe and spdos.exe must be reachable by PATH
or in the same directory. DEVICE=(path)vdosprio.sys in your config.sys file.

Notes:  

The VDD hooks the DOS Int 45h to get a connection to the VDM.  I
hope that nobody uses this Int.  If there are problems with this
Int, recompile the VDD and the pascal library for another Int.

If you set a DOS session which has an idle loop consuming full 
cpu time (such as the Turbo IDE) to time critical (highest) 
priority, the system gets in trouble.  Setting the priority to 
r31 is enough, f is also allowed.  

There is another priority class for VDM's:  SIMULATED INTERRUPT, 
but it doesn't seem to work.  Therefore the sp utility doesn't 
support it.  

The Command-line parsing of SP is not very save:  You can get 
strange errors (such as illegal NPX instruction) when running SP 
with wrong arguments.  

FOR PROGRAMMERS WHO WANT TO USE THE VDOSPRIO DRIVER DIRECTLY:

The driver can be called by Int 45h. The parameters are:

AX: Class

Possible values are:

1H: Idle Class.
2H: Regular Class.
3H: Time-Critical Class. Highest Priority class
4H: Foreground Server Class.
5H: Simulated Interrupt Class.
1680H:  Perform a task switch to another task.

DX: Offset

Possible values are:

0..1Fh: absolute Offset for this Class

Return values:

AX=1: Success.
AX=0: An error occured. No actions taken.

Debug-O-History:

The Version 1.02 contains a completely rewritten VDD for the DOS
sessions (VDOSPRIO.SYS version 2.0).

The Version 1.01 has a minor bug fix in spdos.exe.  There was a
problem passing argv[1] to the DOS program started.

The initial code used as a base for sp.exe is from Scott Dudley,
thanks to him.
